# Limelight Networks - Edge Functions Runtime - Go

This library is **required** for creating a Limelight Networks EdgeFunction using the `Go` runtime.

Unlike other supported runtimes, such as NodeJS or Python, creating a function in Go requires explicitly declared objects that the EdgeFunctions service expects. Therefore, you must compile your function against this library.

## Go Runtime Programming Guide

Please see the official Limelight Networks EdgeFunctions documentation.
