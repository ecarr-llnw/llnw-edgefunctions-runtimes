# Limelight Networks - Edge Functions Runtimes

Included in this repository are the libraries required to write functions for the Limelight Networks EdgeFunction service, in the various environments that are supported. Each function environment, or "runtime", has its own top-level folder in this repository. At this time, only edge functions written in `Go` require a runtime library.

## Modification Warning

These libraries are intended for use in conjunction with the Limelight Networks EdgeFunctions service. Users wishing to modify this library do so at their own risk. Limelight Networks does not guarantee that edge functions built with a modified library will interact properly with the EdgeFunctions service.

## Example Code Disclaimer

The code samples in this repository are provided as-is, as examples only, and Limelight Networks makes no guarantee of their actual functionality.

## Documentation

Please visit the official Limelight Networks EdgeFunctions documentation to learn how to use these libraries.
